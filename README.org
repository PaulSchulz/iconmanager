* icons
** Introduction
A tool for collecting, managing and presenting large numbers of icons.

This web application uses [[https://github.com/mmcgrana/ring][Ring]] and [[https://github.com/weavejester/compojure][Compojure]].

To play around with this example project, you will first need [[https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen][Leiningen]]
installed.

Download the project dependencies with:
#+begin_src shell
  lein deps
#+end_src
Now you can start a development web server with:
#+begin_src shell
  lein ring server
#+end_src
or
#+begin_src shell
  lein ring server-headless
#+end_src

It also makes use of the [[https://github.com/weavejester/ring-refresh][Ring-refresh]] module, which will automatically refresh
the displayed webpage whenever the source files are changed in 'src/' and
'resource/'.

Or you can compile the project into a war-file ready for deployment to a servlet
container like [[http://tomcat.apache.org][Tomcat]] or [[http://jetty.codehaus.org/jetty][Jetty]]
#+begin_src shell
  lein ring uberwar
#+end_src
